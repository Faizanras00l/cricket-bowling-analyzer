# BowlForm AI ‚Äì Cricket Bowling Action Analyzer

BowlForm AI is an AI-powered web application that analyzes cricket bowling actions from video. It uses advanced pose estimation (MediaPipe) and integrates with the DeepSeek model (via OpenRouter) to provide instant, actionable feedback for bowlers.

## üöÄ Capabilities

- **Video Upload:** Accepts `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi` bowling action videos.
- **Pose Estimation:** Extracts key biomechanical metrics (elbow angle, knee angle, arm verticality, stride length) using MediaPipe.
- **AI Coaching Feedback:** Sends pose data to DeepSeek (via OpenRouter) for cricket-specific improvement tips.
- **Real-Time Metrics:** Displays joint angles and stride metrics as the video plays.
- **Dual Video Output:** Generates both a full annotated video and a skeleton-only video.
- **Download Results:** Lets users download the analyzed videos.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, glassmorphic interface with smooth transitions.
